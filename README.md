# Daily Dose

**Daily Dose** is a public repository that showcases a collection of real-time applications built around Natural Language Processing, financial analytics, and interactive data visualization.

This project is intended as a demonstration of practical skills in deploying full-stack ML/NLP tools using Python, Streamlit, and open data sources. It includes work on machine learning, deep learning, forecasting, predictions, sentiment analysis, financial data interpretation, and user-driven interaction pipelines.

More modules and app-level documentation will be added progressively as the project evolves.

# Daily Dose

**Daily Dose** is a public repository demonstrating a collection of real-time AI-powered applications focused on Natural Language Processing, financial analytics, and predictive modeling.

Designed as a showcase of applied skills in AI, data science, and ML engineering, this project includes end-to-end pipelines involving machine learning, deep learning, sentiment analysis, time-series forecasting, and real-time financial data integration â€” all built with Python, Streamlit, and public data sources (with some datasets realistically simulated when access was limited or commercially restricted).

More modules, use cases, and technical documentation will be added as the project evolves.
